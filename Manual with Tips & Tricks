#Step-by-step manual
This manual will describe the steps taken to upload a bootloader on a 'bricked' Arduino MKR Wifi (SAMD21G18A) using a raspberry PI3.

1. As mentioned in the Readme download an follow the steps described in: 
https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-microcontrollers-using-openocd-on-raspberry-pi
The PDF is available on this Github.
  > Compiling OpenOCD: just follow the steps
  > Wire up the target to SWD: 
      TIP! For the Arduino MKR 1010 Wifi find the pin connections on 
          https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/2018/12/swd-debugging-arduino-mkr-wifi-1010.html
          PDF print of the webpage is available on the github.
          (Thanks to GoJimmyPI for his contribution)
      TIP! The wiring shown for the PI2 is the same for the PI3
      TIP! The manual states alternatively to power the board via the raspberry. I tried both and preferred to power over USB as noticed that connection was sometime lost powering the MKR board.
  > Create OpenOCD config
      TIP! Have left my OpenOCD.cfg file on this Github.
      TIP! Although i have changed the adapter_nsrst delay and assert, I don't think it has much impact on succesfull loading. (in my case)
      TIP! I have entered the bcm2835gpio_swd/trst/srst pin numbering, as without it didn't work for me.
      TIP! As an unexperienced Linux user, i have replaced all the [find xxxxxxxx] items with absolute full path names
      TIP! I have not commented out the srst_nogate and had no issues.
      TIP! For me the TargetName / Type / ... table did not show.
      TIP! getting the xPSR.... / pc.... commands although the board is not showing or doing anything IS confirmation all went OK!
  > Opening telnet connection
      TIP! open a new Putty screen and connect with the same username and password.
           download the Telnet functionality using: apt-get Telnet as not standard available on my PI.
           after installation, type telnet 127.0.0.1 4444. Leave the other screen open (without hitting CTRL+C)!
  > Burning bootloader
      TIP! get the latest bootloader files from the Github site: 
          https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd (for Arduino boards).
          (Thanks Arduino for support and sharing! That shows the added value of genuine boards!)
      TIP! i got the latest bootloader file on my PI3 by typing into the command line: wget https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd\https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd/tree/master/bootloaders/mkrwifi1010/samd21_sam_ba_arduino_mkrwifi1010.bin
          HOWEVER, this was a mistake!! As you will notice the bootloaders are 8192byte (exactly the bootloader size). Using the wget function I got a 64kb file downloaded!! 
          > After a lot of hours searching I found out the wget will corrupt the bootloader file.
          > Therefore download the bootloader on your PC and transfer the file to the PI using ftp or in my case, PuTTY SCP (file transfer over SSH)
      TIP! I left a working bootloader in the Github but I strongly advise to download the latest from the official Github
